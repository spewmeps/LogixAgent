This wizard will guide you through deep root cause analysis.

IMPORTANT: You will be asked for EVIDENCE for every claim you make.
Evidence means: specific crash commands, addresses, values, code locations.
NOT: "probably", "seems like", "I think", "usually".

TIP: Have your crash dump analysis results ready. You'll need to cite:
  - crash> sys, log, bt outputs
  - crash> struct, dis, kmem results  
  - Code files, git commits, log files

All responses will be saved to:
